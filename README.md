# :christmas_tree: :snake: :sparkles: Maja's Advent of Code 2022 :sparkles: :snake: :christmas_tree:

Ho, ho, ho, welcome to my 2022 Advent of Code repository!
My goal this year:
- collect at least 30 starts before December 25th

My AoC repositories: [2015](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2015), [2016](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2016), [2017](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2017), [2018](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2018), [2019](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2019), [2020](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2020), [2021](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2021)

## What I learned, what I still don't know

Legend:

:ambulance: - I don't fully understand either the logic or the implementation - HALP!

:hourglass_flowing_sand: - I think this could or should run faster, but I don't know how to optimize it!

:hammer: - Not completely satisfied with solution, but I know how (and plan to) fix it.
