# :christmas_tree: :snake: :sparkles: Maja's Advent of Code 2022 :sparkles: :snake: :christmas_tree:

Ho, ho, ho, welcome to my 2022 Advent of Code repository!
My goal this year:
- collect at least 30 starts before December 25th

My AoC repositories: [2015](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2015), [2016](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2016), [2017](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2017), [2018](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2018), [2019](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2019), [2020](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2020), [2021](https://github.com/mimikrija/AdventOfCode2021)

## What I learned, what I still don't know

Legend:

:ambulance: - I don't fully understand either the logic or the implementation - HALP!

:hourglass_flowing_sand: - I think this could or should run faster, but I don't know how to optimize it!

:hammer: - Not completely satisfied with solution, but I know how (and plan to) fix it.

Puzzle | Solution(s) | Remarks |
---    |---    |----
[Day 1: Calorie Counting](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1) | [Python](python/01.py) | |
[Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2) | [Python](python/02.py) | I manually sorted result outcomes and just sum indices of the scores list. It turned out to be the most elegant solution (to me). |
[Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3) | [Python](python/03.py) | Sets for the win :heart: |
[Day 4: Camp Cleanup](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4) | [Python](python/04.py) | First solution with sets but then opted for working on range limits, similar to very simplified [2021 Day 22](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/22) |
[Day 5: Supply Stacks](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5) | [Python](python/05.py) | Stacks! In my first implementation I didn't bother parsing the first part of input, I just manually typed it - it was faster! |
[Day 6: Tuning Trouble](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6) | [Python](python/06.py) | Strings and zips (and combinations).
